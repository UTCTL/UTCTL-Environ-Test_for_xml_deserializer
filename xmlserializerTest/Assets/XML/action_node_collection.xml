      <probability>
        <!-- Each node has a probability of appearing, default 1. Nodes have conditions that multiply the probability of appearing. These conditions are based on game scores, time elapsed, and nodes already completed. -->
        <conditions>
          <!-- The types of conditions are: [PREREQ, GREEN_SENTIMENT, TECHNOLOGY, ECO_GLOBAL, ECO_REGIONAL, ENV_GLOBAL, ENV_REGIONAL, YEARS_ELAPSED]. Except for the PREREQ type, the rest of the conditions work the same. 

          Prereq conditions must have these fields:
            num_required: # prereqs that must be completed
            satisfied: multiplier if prereqs met
            unsatisfied: multiplier if prereqs not met

          Prereq conditions must also give a list the ids for the prereq nodes. 

          For other condition types, we compare the score of the condition type (the green sentiment score if the type is GREEN_SENTIMENT) to specified ranges. A range is definited by "start,end" and each range corresponds to a value. -1 represents infinity (so "0,-1" would cover all of time). Based on what range the score falls between, the multiplier is given. If the score does not fall within any of the ranges, the multiplier is ignored.
