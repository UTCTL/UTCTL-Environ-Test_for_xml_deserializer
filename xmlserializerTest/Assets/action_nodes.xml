            We compare the score of the condition type (the green sentiment score if the type is GREEN_SENTIMENT) to specified ranges. A range is definited by "start,end" and each range corresponds to a value. -1 represents infinity (so "0,-1" would cover all of time). Based on what range the score falls between, the multiplier is given. If the score does not fall within any of the ranges, the multiplier is ignored. -->

        Prereq conditions must have these fields:
          num_required: # prereqs that must be completed
          satisfied: multiplier if prereqs met
          unsatisfied: multiplier if prereqs not met

        Prereq conditions must also give a list of the ids for the prereq nodes. 

        For other condition types, we compare the score of the condition type (the green sentiment score if the type is GREEN_SENTIMENT) to specified ranges. A range is definited by "start,end" and each range corresponds to a value. -1 represents infinity (so "0,-1" would cover all of time). Based on what range the score falls between, the multiplier is given. If the score does not fall within any of the ranges, the multiplier is ignored.
